Exploratory Data Analysis on the medical charges for Health Insurance Company,Churn Analysis in a Telecom Company and loan approval for Banking sector

Here in this repository there are different Exploratory Data Analysis Projects.The main purpose of these projects is to understand each of the 
features in the dataset like its distribution and presence of outliers as well as missing values.
NOTE: Here in these Projects I have not traeted outliers,I have just taken insights of which features play main role in effecting the target feature.


In Healthcare Project ,the medical charges of the persons is our target.There are various features like age,bmi,number of children,region,smoker,sex
 is given .With EDA we can see what features are affecting the medical charges.
 Similarly Churn is our target variable in Telecom Churn Analysis ,so what are the factors causing the subscriber to churn from the services.This
 is we can see in this project. 
 In the Banking_Credit_Risk we EDA we can see what are possible factors a bank can look for while approving loan for a customer so that the defaulting
 can be avoided.
